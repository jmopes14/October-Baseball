          <h3>What is baseball</h3>
    Baseball is america's past time. The art of hitting a ball coming at you at 95 miles per hour is something you can't teach. The timing for this article is perfect with the playoffs in session. This is when baseball is played at a high level with a lot of viewers and pressure. Baseball has taught me many lessons that I can take into the future.
